As my classmate took a full swing, the bat\\nslipped out of his hands and came \\x00ying toward me before striking me\\ndirectly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of impact.\\n\\ue062e bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose\\ninto a distorted U-shape. \\ue062e collision sent the so\\ue09d tissue of my brain\\nslamming into the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of swelling surged\\nthroughout my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose, multiple\\nskull fractures, and two shattered eye sockets.\\nWhen I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to\\nhelp. I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my\\nclassmates took the shirt oﬀ his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug\\nthe stream of blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I\\nwas unaware of how seriously I had been injured.\\nMy teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long\\nwalk to the nurse’s oﬃce: across the \\x00eld, down the hill, and back into\\nschool. Random hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We took our\\ntime and walked slowly. Nobody realized that every minute mattered.\\nWhen we arrived at the nurse’s oﬃce, she asked me a series of questions.\\n“What year is it?”\\n“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.\\n“Who is the president of the United States?”\\n“Bill Clinton,” I said. \\ue062e correct answer was George W. Bush.\\n“What is your mom’s name?”\\n“Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.'),\n",

I struggled with\\nbasic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my \\x00rst seizure of the\\nday. \\ue062en I stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors hurried to supply me\\nwith oxygen, they also decided the local hospital was unequipped to handle\\nthe situation and ordered a helicopter to \\x00y me to a larger hospital in\\nCincinnati.\\nI was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the helipad\\nacross the street. \\ue062e stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one nurse\\npushed me along while another pumped each breath into me by hand. My\\nmother, who had arrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed into\\nthe helicopter beside me.

Brailsford said, “\\ue062e whole principle\\ncame from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of\\nthat goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a\\nsigni\\x00cant increase when you put them all together.”\\nBrailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you might\\nexpect from a professional cycling team. \\ue062ey redesigned the bike seats to'),\n",

You need to know how habits work and how to design\\nthem to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\\nY O U R  H A B I T S  C A N  C O M P O U N D  F O R  Y O U  O R  A G A I N S T  Y O U\\nP o s i t i v e  C o m p o u n d i n g\\nP r o d u c t i v i t y  c o m p o u n d s .  Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any\\ngiven day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an\\nold task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can\\nhandle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.\\nK n o w l e d g e  c o m p o u n d s .  Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a\\ncommitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book\\nyou read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways\\nof thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge\\nworks. It builds up, like compound interest.”\\nR e l a t i o n s h i p s  c o m p o u n d .  People reflect your behavior back to you. The more\\nyou help others, the more others want to help you.

The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting\\nresponsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood\\npressure.

Each one was\\na goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school, for\\nthe weights I wanted to li\\ue09d in the gym, for the pro\\x00ts I wanted to earn in\\nbusiness. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually, I\\nbegan to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and\\nnearly everything to do with the systems I followed.\\nWhat’s the diﬀerence between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I \\x00rst\\nlearned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert comic. Goals\\nare about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes\\nthat lead to those results.\\nIf you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your\\nsystem is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches,\\nand conduct practice.\\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar\\nbusiness. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees,\\nand run marketing campaigns.\\nIf you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your\\nsystem is how o\\ue09den you practice, how you break down and tackle\\ndiﬃcult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your\\ninstructor.\\nNow for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals\\nand focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if\\nyou were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a\\nchampionship and focused only on what your team does at practice each\\nday, would you still get results?\\nI think you would.'),\n",

In the words of three-time Super\\nBowl winner Bill Walsh, “\\ue062e score takes care of itself.” \\ue062e same is true for\\nother areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals.\\nFocus on your system instead.\\nWhat do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not.\\nGoals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making\\nprogress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time\\nthinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.\\nProblem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.\\nGoal setting suﬀers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate\\non the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume\\nthat ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people\\nwho had the same objective but didn’t succeed.\\nEvery Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get\\nthe job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then\\nthe goal cannot be what diﬀerentiates the winners from the losers. It wasn’t\\nthe goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to\\nthe top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year\\nbefore—just like every other professional team. \\ue062e goal had always been\\nthere. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small\\nimprovements that they achieved a diﬀerent outcome.\\nProblem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.\\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you\\nsummon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now.\\nBut if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy\\nroom in the \\x00rst place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and\\nhoping for another burst of motivation.

When you solve problems at the\\nresults level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good,\\nyou need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the\\noutputs will \\x00x themselves.\\nProblem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.\\n\\ue062e implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then\\nI’ll be happy.” \\ue062e problem with a goals-\\x00rst mentality is that you’re\\ncontinually putting happiness oﬀ until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into\\nthis trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years, happiness was always\\nsomething for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained\\ntwenty pounds of muscle or a\\ue09der my business was featured in the New York\\nTimes, then I could \\x00nally relax.\\nFurthermore, goals create an “either-or” con\\x00ict: either you achieve your\\ngoal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You\\nmentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. \\ue062is is misguided.\\nIt is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey\\nyou had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your\\nsatisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.\\nA systems-\\x00rst mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love\\nwith the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give\\nyourself permission to be happy. You can be satis\\x00ed anytime your system is\\nrunning.
